## Motivation
This application is a rewrite of the <a href=https://github.com/jameskokoska/AnimalCrossingNH-App>original</a> from scratch in React Native.

The goal of this rewrite is to make a more modular application that can be updated easier. The original app written in Flutter had various bugs relating to asynchronous function calls, reactive component layouts, and lacked a modular design with much repetitive code. After learning ReactJS, this project was started.

Since this application is written in React Native, support for an iOS app is possible but untested.

Many applications already existing provide a lack of features and intuitive UI layouts. I wanted to create a free application with no advertisements to create a pleasant user experience.

## Languages and Translations
All translations have been created from the help of volunteers listed within the application.

## Install and Run Application Locally
This application uses Expo and React Native. Install expo. Navigate into the ```animal_crossing_app``` folder (using ```cd .\animal_crossing_app\```) repositories root location. Then install dependencies using ```npm install```. After installing packages use ```npm start``` or ```expo start```. Open the Expo development application on android device and connect through the localhost on the local network.
